# QA Test Automation (QATA) framework
for UC Berkeley Student Information Systems (SIS) Campus Solutions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ucberkeley/sis-qa-test-auto.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ucberkeley/sis-qa-test-auto)


## Environment variables
By default, the following values are used. New values must be set while running the framework
and will be automatically picked up.

* `SIS_TEST_DIR=<project-dir>/test`: If using external test directory, set to location of
external test directory.
* `SIS_LOGS_DIR=<project-dir>/logs`: If using external logs directory, set to location of
external logs directory.
* `SIS_SERVER_PORT=8421`: Set to port number that server should listen on.
* `SIS_DASHBOARD_PORT=3000`: Set to port number that dashboard should be available on.
number.
* `SIS_TEST_WEBDRIVER=selenium`: Selenium WebDriver runs test on the graphical Firefox browser.
If deploying in an environment wihtout a graphical interface (for example, a remote server), set
`SIS_TEST_WEBDRIVER=poltergeist`. The framework will then use Poltergeist WebDriver on PhantomJS
headless browser.


## Methods for setting up and running framework
The QA Test Automation framework is itself highly automated. There are a number of ways to set
up and run the framework. The two main components: server and dashboard have been
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)ized. Local installation is also possible but not recommended.

First, add the configuration/credential files required for running the tests by following
[these instructions](test/README.md).

Then, follow instructions in one of the following sections.

### Using Docker Engine
This method uses pre-built images from the
[ucberkeley public Docker registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/ucberkeley/). Alternatively, images
can be built locally by running `scripts/build.sh` (after installing Docker Engine).

1. [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
1. Install the QATA framework with `scripts/install.sh`. This will create a symlink to the server
script in /usr/bin.
1. Run the service with `qata start` (may required sudo. If using external test
and/or logs directory, run as `sudo -E qata start` to pass in environment variables). The first
run will take longer since the docker container will be downloaded and then run.
1. When required, stop the service with `qata stop`, or restart with `qata restart`
1. If required, attach to the service with `qata attach`.

### Using Docker Compose (along with Docker Engine)
This method uses Docker Compose to automate the process of building and running images.

1. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (in addition to [Docker
Engine](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)).
1. In the project directory, run `docker-compose up` (may require sudo. If using external test
and/or logs directory, run as `sudo -E docker-compose up` to pass in environment variables). The
first run will take longer since the Docker images will be built and then run.

### Using Vagrant
This method runs Docker Engine inside a Vagrant VM.

1. In the project directory, run `vagrant up`. This will also build the Docker images inside the
VM and set all environment variables.
1. `vagrant ssh` into the VM and then start the service with `sudo -E qata start`.

### Installing locally
This method may speed up testing, but is otherwise not recommended. Follow instructions in
[qatserver/README.md](qatserver/README.md) and [dashboard/README.md](dashboard/README.md).

## Additional notes
1. Keep the test execution server files and Gemfile (and Gemfile.lock) in docker/sis-qa-test-auto
in sync with corresponding file(s) in the server directory and the test directory by running
`scripts/sync.sh`. The up-to-date Gemfile will ensure that all required gems are installed when
the sis-qa-test-auto docker container is being built. Though all dependencies are checked for
during test execution, and installed if not satisfied, having them pre-installed will speed up
test execution considerably.
1. You can clean up the logs folder by running `scripts/cleanup.sh`.
